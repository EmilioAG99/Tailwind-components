# Tailwind-components

Within this repo, you can find many useful components created using Tailwind CSS and plain HTML. The idea of generating these mini-project was to get a better understanding of Tailwind and the integration with HTML.

## Dependencies
  In case you want to test these projects, all you need is to open the HTML file included in any directory.
 
  In case that you want to make any changes to the styling, all you need is to have Node installed and run the next commands:
 - npm install
 - npm run watch
 
 These commands will help Tailwind to identify those changes and display the proper styling in the HTML file.
